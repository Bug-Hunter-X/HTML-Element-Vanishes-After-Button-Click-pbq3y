This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in HTML where a DOM element unexpectedly disappears after a button click event. The issue stems from setting the element's display style to "none" without providing a way to make it visible again.  The solution showcases how to correctly handle the visibility of an element by using a toggle effect or restoring the element's visibility.
